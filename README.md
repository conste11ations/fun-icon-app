# Create React App example with Material-UI, TypeScript, Redux and Routing

This is a new version with React Hooks, Material-UI 4 and React-Redux 7 (with hooks!). We use this template for all our new projects. If you want to bootstrap a project with the classic approach without hooks but with class components, you are welcome to use the [previous version](https://github.com/innFactory/create-react-app-material-typescript-redux/tree/v1).
